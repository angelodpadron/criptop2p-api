# CriptoP2P API [^*]

## MVP for Peer-to-Peer (p2p) use of cryptocurrency.

---

# Running the app with Docker

- ### Open a terminal inside the root folder of the project
- ### Run the command `docker-compose up`
- ### Now the app will start running on `localhost:8080`

---

# Important

### The application uses the BCRA API to obtain data on the USD to ARS exchange rate. The BCRA API requires an access token to use, which can be obtained from [here](https://estadisticasbcra.com/api/documentacion).

[^*]: This project is from a college assignment, not something to deploy in production... For now at least. So fell free
to fork and modify as much as you like :)
