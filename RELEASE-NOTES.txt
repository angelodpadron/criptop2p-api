ENTREGA 3 TAG 3.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* Added endpoint to obtain the last 24 hours quotations of certain cryptocurrency.
* Added cache to the quotations data endpoints to improve response times.
* Updated log execution details.

OTHERS

* Added architecture tests.
* Added the integration tests that was pending.

NOTES

* In order to cache the crypto-quotations endpoints, an instance of redis must be running locally in the port 6379,
  and the app must be running using the "dev" profile.
* The deployment done on Heroku is no longer available due to recent changes of their services.
* Because of the above, another branch might be created with the files and configurations required to run the app
  using Docker.
